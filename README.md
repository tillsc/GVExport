GVExport
========

This is a repository for a webtrees module known as GVExport. GVExport's goal is to produce an "all in one tree" of every person in a family tree and their relationships. You can view the tree in webtrees and click on individuals of families to go to their page in webtrees, and if the GraphViz software is installed on the server it can produce output in multiple file formats such as JPG, SVG, PDF, and others.

One of the display options renders output like this:

Webtrees
--------

[Webtrees](https://webtrees.net/) is an online collaborative genealogy application. This can be hosted on your own server by following the [Install instructions](https://webtrees.net/install/). If you are familiar with Docker, you might like to install Webtrees using [this unofficial docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/nathanvaughn/webtrees).

Installation of GVExport
------------

To install GVExport, copy files to modules_v4 directory in webtrees and rename the folder to GVExport. For more detail, see the [install instructions](https://github.com/Neriderc/GVExport/wiki/Installing-the-module).

GraphViz
--------

By default GVExport can display the output in the browser. To generate files such as PNG, JPG, SVG, and PDF, the GraphViz software is needed on the server. See [Installation of GraphViz](https://github.com/Neriderc/GVExport/wiki/Installation-of-GraphViz).

GVExport Module
---------------

Once installed (and enabled), go to *Charts -> GVExport* to see the options.

Some further but non-exhaustive instructions can be found in [this forum post](https://www.webtrees.net/index.php/en/forum/4-customising/35801-display-complex-all-in-on-tree-with-gvexport?start=0) from the previous version.

Older Versions
--------------

We attempt to keep up with the latest stable (non-prerelease) version of webtrees. You can see the latest release of webtrees [here](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/releases). Older versions are not supported. *However*, as we progress through webtrees versions, we are releasing GVExport versions. These are listed on the [Releases page](https://github.com/Neriderc/GVExport/releases). If you are not using the latest version of webtrees, and the latest release of GVExport isn't working for you, you may want to try an older release.

For versions earlier than 2.0.21 you can try the [source repository](https://github.com/tillsc/GVExport), but note this DOES NOT work for 2.0.22 and later.

This repository
---------------
This repository was forked from [tillsc/GVExport](https://github.com/tillsc/GVExport) after community pull requests had not been merged for some time. [A post](https://www.webtrees.net/index.php/en/forum/4-customising/35801-display-complex-all-in-on-tree-with-gvexport) had been made on the webtrees forum stating that GVExport had been brought up to date to work with webtrees 2.0, but that the developer could not provide ongoing support. After a webtrees update broke the module, this fork was created to maintain compatibility.
